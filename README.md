This code snippet demonstrates two methods for reversing a given string, str.

Using a Loop:

A for loop iterates over each character in the original string from the last to the first.
Characters are appended in reverse order to the newString.
The reversed string is then logged to the console.
Using Array Methods:

The split method is employed to convert the string into an array of characters.
The reverse method reverses the order of elements in the array.
The join method merges the reversed array back into a string.
The reversed string is then logged to the console.
Both methods achieve the same result of reversing the original string, showcasing different approachesâ€”one utilizing a loop and the other leveraging built-in array methods.
